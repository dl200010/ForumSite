Say hello to Editorial, a blog/magazine-ish template built around a toggleable "locking"
sidebar (scroll down to see what I mean) and an accordion-style menu. Not the usual landing
page/portfolio affair you'd expect to see at HTML5 UP, but I figured for my 41st (!!!)
template I'd change it up a little. Enjoy :)

Install
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Have PHP 7.3.0 installed.
Have MySQL installed and database set up.
Have 'index.php' a default document on the website
Copy all files into root of website.
Open /inc_mysql_settings.php and create the ini file listed there and modify
      inc file to point to the right folder outside of the website root
      directly. (currently at 'c:\inetpub\')
Go to login in a browser ON the server that is running the PHP.
This is needed because to create an admin user, you need to come from 127.0.0.1
Log in as "admin@admin.com" using password "admin"
You will be redirected to an admin creation page.
This page will no longer work once any accounts exist in the database.
It does not validate that the email you are entering is a real email,
      just that it follows the standard.
Now log in as the just create admin.
